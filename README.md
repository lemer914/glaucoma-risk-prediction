# glaucoma-risk-prediction

## Description
This repository contains the results of my summer 2024 data science internship at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, California. The goal was to create a machine learning model capable of predicting five-year incident glaucoma risk from phenotypic and genotypic data. Code to be added soon.
